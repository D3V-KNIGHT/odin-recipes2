    <h2>Easy Fried Eggs</h2>
    <p>Here's how it's done. Warm up a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and throw in a drizzle of oil or melted
        butter(you really don't need a whole lot). From there, sprinkle a scant handful of shredded cheese (Cheddar,
        pepper-Jack, and Swiss would all be great) directly into the hot skillet, sprinkling it to create a 4-inch (or
        so) cheese web. Be sure to leave some openings where you can see the pan through the shredded cheese. Then,
        crack an egg directly over the center of this shredded cheese web.</p>
    <p>Depending on how you want to cook the egg, you can either cover the pan at this point for a more well done
        center, or you can do this entire process uncovered for a sunny, runny yolk. Either way, you want to keep your
        flame on medium-high heat so that you get crispy, crunchy cheese on the bottom as well as a frizzled egg white.
        Once the egg is almost done cooking, tilt your pan a little bit and spoon any hot oil or butter onto the white
        to complete its cooking.</p>
